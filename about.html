Detects and lists feeds (rss,atom,json) of a page. RSS and Atom feeds are still
a very useful method to keep up to date on news and other kind of information.
On many sites the feed capabilites are still available but sometimes badly
maintained, so that it can be hard to access or find these. This Addon tries to
make it easy to find all available feeds a site has to offer.

<b>Usage: (Basic) </b>
<ol>
  <li>
    Visit a site which contains feeds for example:
    <ul>
      <li>https://blog.mozilla.org/</li>
      <li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS</li>
      <li>https://www.youtube.com/user/Mozilla</li>
      <li>
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fviHC7xlX0&list=PLnRGhgZaGeBvDBzQGf4M8HIepPXA9cq-C
      </li>
      <li>https://jsonfeed.org/</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The toolbar icon will be colored when you visit a page where at least one
    feed is found
  </li>
  <li>click on the toolbar icon, to show the feeds</li>
</ol>

<b>Usage: (Advanced) </b>
You can write your own feed probing / detection functions in Javascript The
supplied function must return an Array as URLs as Strings. Those URLs will be
probed via a HEAD Request and if the server returns a Content-Type which might
align with a feed object, it will be added to the feed list. Example functions
can be found on the github page (see. custom-feed-detectors.json)
